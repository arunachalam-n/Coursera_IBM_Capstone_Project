# Coursera_IBM_Capstone_Project
This repo is created for the final submission of the IBM_DataScience_Pofessional Certificate Capstone Project


In this project 
We'll web scrape from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M the postal codes of Toronto.

We'll convert addresses into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. 

Also, by using Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Toronto. 

Using the API we'll get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use these feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. 

We will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task.

Finally, use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto and their emerging clusters.

Libraries Which are Used to Develope the Project:<br>
Pandas: For creating and manipulating dataframes.<br>
Folium: Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of using interactive leaflet map.<br>
Scikit Learn: For importing k-means clustering.<br>
JSON: Library to handle JSON files.<br>
Geocoder: To retrieve Location Data.<br>
Beautiful Soup and Requests: To scrap and library to handle http requests.<br>
Matplotlib: Python Plotting Module.<br>
FourSquare API: to get to know about neighbourhood using the ratings. <br>
